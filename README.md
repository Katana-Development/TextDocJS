# TextDocJS
TextDocJS is an object orientated plain-text module that creates abstractions of plain text-files. The module is very simple, and very small, however; Native Node.js doesn't offer somthing as OOP as TextDocJS. This is a synchronous module, and it is in its first version, I am working on the Asynchronous Version, which will probably be a month or so from the date this Repository was created. Also working on README.md markdown. MIT License and free to use, infact I hope someone does try it, the code used to write is this module is clean, simply and dry. The code looks and feels good.
